            <p> Turtle populations have declined substantially over the past century mainly from direct take of adults and juveniles for their <br>
                carapaces and meat, as well as the harvesting of eggs for consumption across the country and Southeast Asia. The Philippines <br>
                is home to 5 of the 7 sea turtle species in the world: Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Leatherback Turtle <br>
                and Olive Ridley. All species are endangered and are listed on the IUCN Red List. Turtle conservation work in the Philippines <br>
                spans almost four decades. <br>
                <br>
                Working with the national and regional authorities and partners, we are providing data by conducting assessments of the status <br>
                of turtle populations in the Philippines outside TIHPA, focusing on small remote nesting areas and feeding grounds, using<br> 
                photo-identification, telemetry, genetics, habitat assessment, tourism interactions, stranding data as well as assessing threats <br>
                like bycatch, nest depredation and poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Our current research focuses mainly on three species:
